# Sanctuary Team

## üåê Who are we?

Sanctuary Team is a collection of community developers who's collective goal is to bring an official trading and auction house system to the majority of users through the modern web application technologies. We have decided to open the projects up to engage with those who want to contribute and bring the best possible product to the userbase.

Interesting fun facts about the team:

- We all enjoy eating cookies when Developers do campfire chats.
- The Diablo 4 Sanctuary team is a 60+ member wide voluntary team.
